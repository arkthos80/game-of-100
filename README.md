# Game-Of-100 Puzzle Solver

## Overview
This Go project provides a fast and efficient solver for the "100" solitaire number game. It employs three distinct strategies to fill a 10x10 grid with numbers from 1 to 100, adhering to the game's placement rules. The solver is designed to execute multiple runs within seconds, making it highly effective for finding solutions.

## Game Rules
The "100" solitaire number game involves placing numbers from 1 to 100 on a 10x10 grid. The rules are as follows:
- Place the number **1** in any grid position.
- Subsequent numbers must be placed:
  - Horizontally or vertically, skipping two squares from the last number.
  - Diagonally, skipping one square from the last number.
- The game ends when no more numbers can be placed following these rules. The goal is to fill the entire grid.

## Strategies
The solver implements the following strategies to navigate through the grid:
- **Random**: Places numbers randomly while respecting the game's rules.
- **CrossFirst**: Prioritizes horizontal and vertical moves before considering diagonal ones.
- **DiagonalFirst**: Prefers diagonal moves before exploring horizontal and vertical options.

## Usage
Run the solver with the desired strategy and optional parameters for maximum timeout and starting grid position:

```go
// Command line usage
game100 STRATEGY MAX_TIMEOUT_SEC [X] [Y]

// Example
game100 CrossFirst 5 0 0
```

Replace STRATEGY with Random, CrossFirst, or DiagonalFirst. MAX_TIMEOUT_SEC is the maximum time in seconds the solver will run before stopping. [X] [Y] are optional parameters to specify the starting position on the grid.
